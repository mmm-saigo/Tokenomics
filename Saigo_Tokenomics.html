<h1>SAIGO Token Economics Document</h1>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmm-saigo/Tokenomics/refs/heads/main/Saigo_Tokenomics_zh.MD">切换到中文版本</a></p>

<h2>I. Introduction</h2>

<p>With the rapid development of blockchain on-chain DEXs and launchpads, the fair launch token distribution model is increasingly gaining market traction. Trading tools that provide on-chain trading opportunity discovery and analysis have become a hot track in the crypto space. Whether it’s leading platforms like GMGN.AI, AVE.AI, DEXX, and various WEB3 wallets, or the continuously emerging Telegram Bot projects, all are vying for a share of this market. However, the decentralized and security issues of Telegram Bot projects also bring higher selection costs and risks to users.</p>

<p><strong>Token Purpose</strong></p>

<p>The SAIGO token (SAIGO) plays multiple roles within the SAIGO platform ecosystem:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Platform Fee Discount:</strong> Effectively reduces transaction costs for users on the SAIGO platform, enhancing the cost-effectiveness of user transactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Project Governance:</strong> Grants token holders the valuable right to participate in project decisions, making users important participants in platform development.</li>
  <li><strong>Return Distribution:</strong> Reasonably distributes the substantial returns generated by the project to token holders and ecosystem contributors, incentivizing all parties to jointly promote platform development.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Document Objective</strong></p>

<p>This document aims to provide a comprehensive and in-depth explanation of the SAIGO token’s economic model, distribution plan, governance mechanism, and value capture strategy, offering users and investors a comprehensive and detailed understanding.</p>

<h2>II. Token Information</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Token Name and Symbol:</strong> SAIGO (SAIGO)</li>
  <li><strong>Token Type:</strong> A dual-attribute token combining utility and governance functions.</li>
  <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> The total supply of SAIGO tokens is 1,000,000,000 (1 billion), with a fixed maximum supply to ensure token value stability.</li>
  <li><strong>Initial Distribution:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public Sale (10%):</strong> No lock-up restrictions, facilitating timely investor participation.</li>
      <li><strong>Team (30%):</strong> A 36-month linear vesting mechanism, including a 6-month cliff, followed by 5% unlocks every six months.</li>
      <li><strong>Ecosystem Development (30%):</strong> Used for airdrop incentives, liquidity incentives, product ecosystem incentives, and more, to promote ecosystem prosperity.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Reserve (24%):</strong> Primarily used for exchange listings (CEX), legal services, and related matters.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity (5%):</strong> Permanently added to the liquidity pool, with liquidity provided by funds raised by the team, ensuring smooth market trading.</li>
      <li><strong>Fundraising Rewards (1%):</strong> No lock-up, timely rewards for fundraising contributors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Token Standard:</strong> Complies with the BEP-20 (BSC) standard.</li>
  <li><strong>Unlock Mechanism:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Apart from the 16% unlocked tokens, other token unlocks are subject to both price and date conditions. Specifically, the 30-day average price before the expiration date must be 200% higher than the price at the previous unlock, with the initial price set at the fundraising success price.</li>
      <li>Team-unlocked tokens will be released to the team’s multi-signature address, and ecosystem and community reserved tokens will be released to the community’s multi-signature address.</li>
      <li>If there are no actual plans or needs, released tokens must be re-locked into the contract address, and all unlock processes are strictly controlled by smart contracts to ensure fairness, impartiality, and transparency.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>III. Token Utility</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ecosystem Functions:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fee Discount:</strong> Users can flexibly use SAIGO tokens to discount part or all of the transaction fees when trading on the SAIGO platform, reducing transaction costs.</li>
      <li><strong>Governance Voting:</strong> SAIGO token holders have the right to participate in important platform decisions, such as deciding on new feature launches and parameter adjustments, enhancing user control over the platform.</li>
      <li><strong>Reward Distribution:</strong> Transaction fees, profits, and other revenues generated by the platform will be distributed to SAIGO ecosystem contributors in proportion, realizing profit sharing between users and the platform.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity Mining:</strong> Users can earn corresponding rewards by providing liquidity for SAIGO, further incentivizing market participation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Value Capture Mechanism:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Project returns will directly incentivize liquidity providers (LPs), staking providers, and community governors. By reasonably distributing transaction fees and providing staking rewards, token holders are fully incentivized, enhancing the token’s attractiveness and value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>IV. Token Distribution Plan</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Distribution Schedule:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public Sale:</strong> Distribution is carried out immediately after fundraising is completed, ensuring investors receive tokens in a timely manner.</li>
      <li><strong>Team:</strong> After a 6-month cliff period, enter a 36-month linear vesting phase, with 5% unlocked every 6 months, ensuring the long-term interests of the team are consistent with platform development.</li>
      <li><strong>Ecosystem Development:</strong> Tokens are gradually released according to the actual needs of platform development, precisely promoting ecosystem construction.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Reserve:</strong> Tokens are gradually released according to the specific needs of exchange listings and legal services, ensuring reasonable use of resources.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Permanently locked to maintain the stability of market transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Fundraising Rewards:</strong> Distributed immediately after fundraising is completed, timely rewarding fundraising contributors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Inflation/Deflation Model:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The total supply of SAIGO tokens is constant, but the platform will achieve a deflationary effect by using effective mechanisms such as buybacks and burns, enhancing the token’s scarcity and value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>V. Governance Model</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Governance Mechanism:</strong> On-chain voting is used to ensure the openness, transparency, and efficiency of the governance process.</li>
  <li><strong>Decision-Making Process:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Community members submit proposals through the governance page provided by the team.</li>
      <li>SAIGO token holders decide whether to pass the proposals through on-chain voting.</li>
      <li>After the proposal is passed, the team is responsible for implementation to ensure effective implementation of decisions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Governance Incentives:</strong> To encourage token holders to actively participate in governance voting, users participating in voting will receive certain rewards, further enhancing community activity and cohesion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>VI. Risk Control</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and SAIGO token prices may be affected by market sentiment.</li>
  <li><strong>Technical Risk:</strong> Smart contracts may have security vulnerabilities that affect platform operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> There is uncertainty in cryptocurrency regulatory policies, which may affect project development.</li>
  <li><strong>Competition Risk:</strong> There are already some competitors in the market, and SAIGO needs to continuously innovate to maintain competitiveness.</li>
  <li><strong>Response Strategy:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk Diversification:</strong> The team will actively monitor market dynamics and adopt risk diversification strategies to reduce the impact of market fluctuations on token value.</li>
      <li><strong>Security Audit:</strong> Regular smart contract audits will be conducted to ensure platform security.</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance Operation:</strong> The team will closely monitor changes in regulatory policies and actively communicate with regulatory agencies to ensure compliant project operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Technological Innovation:</strong> The team will continuously carry out technological innovation to improve platform functionality and user experience to maintain market competitiveness.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>VII. Summary</h2>

<p>The SAIGO token economic model aims to achieve sustainable platform development through reasonable token distribution, diversified token uses, and effective governance mechanisms. SAIGO will continue to improve platform functions, expand application scenarios, and become a leading platform in the BSC chain market.</p>
